  <h3>A couple cool things I made in HTML and Javascript</h3>
  <button onclick="getLocation();" class="button">Show Geolocation</button>
  <p id="demo" style="color: black; font-weight: bold;";></p>   
  <script>
var x = document.getElementById("demo");

    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
    } else {
        x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
