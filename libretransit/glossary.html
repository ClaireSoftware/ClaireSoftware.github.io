<div class="h"><h3 id="gender-binary">gender binary</h3><a aria-hidden="true" href="#gender-binary">[link]</a></div>
<p>The concept that there are only 2 genders, namely male and female. The gender binary does not exist, but it is enforced in most cultures. In some Asian cultures, ‘third gender’ was and is accepted, as well as in the Americas before it become occupied by Europeans, later forming Canada and the United States. Though it doesn’t exist, it is used as a point of reference and many people, trans or cis, identify within it. At the same time, there really are cis people. The gender binary is explored in depth in some movies, e.g. The Matrix trilogy</p>
