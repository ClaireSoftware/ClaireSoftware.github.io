<p>We don’t have much information yet about trans men, but you can the <a href="http://www.ftmguide.org/">Hudson FTM Resource Guide</a>, which contains a lot of useful information.</p>

<div class="h"><h2 id="hrt">Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#hrt">[link]</a></div>
<p>As a trans man, typically you would (if you were going to transition) take what is called <em>HRT</em> or <em>hormone replacement therapy</em>. This will give you the same estrogen/testosterone balance as a typical cis man.</p>
<p>With HRT, several things will happen to you (this list is not exhaustive):</p>
<ul>
<li>You will start growing body and facial hair</li>
<li>Your voice will start deepening</li>
<li>You’ll get male pattern baldness when you’re older (scalp hair)</li>
<li>Potentially increased libido</li>
<li>Emotional changes (varies depending on person)</li>
<li>Increase sweat and body odour production</li>
<li>Periods will eventually stop (at higher doses of testosterone)</li>
</ul>
<p>More information is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_%28female-to-male%29">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p><em>Your mileage may vary! Some people don’t get changes, while others might only see some of these changes, or they will see them in varying degrees. It all depends on your body (and what type of hormones you take, at what dosages, etc). All of this depends on age, genetics, etc. There’s no telling what will happen to the individual trans person, you just have to see what happens basically.</em></p>

<p>Info on HRT for trans men: http://www.ftmguide.org/ttypes.html</p>
<p>We have information about getting HRT on the Transit site. See:<br />

<div class="h"><h1 id="stp">Stand to pee devices</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#stp">[link]</a></div>
<p>You can find these devices online. They allow you to pee while standing up, e.g. at urinals in male bathrooms. You should get a 2-in-1 STP and packer device (see notes about packers below).</p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="packers">Packers</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#packers">[link]</a></div>
<p>A packer is a device that you wear on your crotch, to give the appearance of a bulge, which cis men have when they wear trousers. You can see a bulge from their penis. A packer will give you the same appearance, if you’ve not had surgery.</p>
<p>Make sure to get a 2-in-1 packer that also has stand-to-pee functionality.</p>
<p>Here is an excellent YouTube video about packers, which all trans men should watch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2LEh41xTYw" class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2LEh41xTYw</a></p>
<div class="h"><h1 id="packers">Surgery</h1><a aria-hidden="true" href="#packers">[link]</a></div>
<p>You can get surgery to give you male genitalia, and to remove your breasts.</p>
<p>If you haven’t had <em>top surgery</em> yet, you can wear a <em>binder</em> which will reduce the appearance of your breasts. Your wear this under your shirt.</p>
<p>You can use a <em>stand-to-pee device</em> if you want to stand while peeing (e.g. at public urinals) if you haven’t had bottom surgery yet.</p>
