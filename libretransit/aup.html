<div class="h"><h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#our-pledge">[link]</a></div>
<p>In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and participants wish that participation in our community and our community will be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#our-standards">[link]</a></div>
<p>Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
<li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
<li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
<li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
<li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances</li>
<li>Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks</li>
<li>Public or private harassment</li>
<li>Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission</li>
<li>Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these behaviours, such as use of sexualized language and soliciting sexual attention, are accepted inside sections of our community labelled NSFW (for instance, the ##transit-nsfw IRC channel).</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="minors">Minors</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#minors">[link]</a></div>
<p>We recognize that, yes, children do come to Transit. This includes reading the website and also joining the IRC channels.</p>
<p>Discussions about sex should, generally speaking, be limited to the NSFW channel, if discussed on IRC.</p>
<p>This is especially true, regarding laws surrounding legal age of consent. Any such discussion should be done in -nsfw.</p>
<p>We in Transit will not tolerate sexual abuse of any kind, regardless of the ages of people involved. Survivors may have been so at a young age, below the legal age of consent in their country, or above it. This section of our rules is written precisely because we do not want any person to be triggered in our chatrooms. We wish for Transit to be a safe space.</p>
<p>We also do not want to cast negative judgement or get involved in peoples affairs.</p>
<p>Opinions about legal age of consent varies, as do the laws in many countries. Generally, under 18s are to be considered minors, and unable to have informed consent. This is a safe figure, compatible with most countries that members of Transit may come from (in some countries, it’s higher than this).</p>
<p>If interactions requiring a level of consent take place, make sure that the person you’re speaking to is actually providing consent. It’s inevitable that, over time, relations between people will develop. Use your best judgement; for instance, if two people are both 16, and 16 is the legal age of consent in their country, it’s OK. This is not to say that the law is in any way a useful guide.</p>
<p>If you are a victim of abuse, or know someone who is, in our community, then please report it immediately. This is irrespective of age.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="drug-talk-including-alcoholtobacco">Drug talk (including alcohol/tobacco)</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#drug-talk-including-alcoholtobacco">[link]</a></div>
<p>We’re not against drugs, generally. We believe in freedom of choice.</p>
<p>That being said, some people are recovering addicts of a given drug, and may be triggered hearing about a given drug.</p>
<p>All drug talk should be moved to channels labelled NSFW.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#our-responsibilities">[link]</a></div>
<p>Community participants are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Community participants have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to these conduct guidelines, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="scope">Scope</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#scope">[link]</a></div>
<p>These conduct guidelines apply both within community spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the community or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official Transit e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of Transit may be further defined and clarified by the leadership.</p>
<p>Specifically, in normal circumstances, the scope of these guidelines apply directly to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The IRC channels (##transit and ##transit-nsfw on freenode)</li>
<li>The notabug instance (at <a href="https://notabug.org/vimuser/transit-website" class="uri">https://notabug.org/vimuser/transit-website</a>), which also includes issue reports and site changes where the site is hosted</li>
<li>The contents of any contributions to Transit, including commits to the Git repository and/or website.</li>
</ul>
<div class="h"><h2 id="complaints">Complaints</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#complaints">[link]</a></div>
<p>All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The leadership is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.</p>
<p>Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting one of the moderators privately via IRC private message (see list below):</p>
<p>In the interest of maintaining our privacy, you must log onto the IRC channel and contact anyone there who has operator privileges.</p>
<p>This command can tell you who has operator rights, and therefore a list of people to go to when you wish to make a complaint:</p>
<pre><code>/msg chanserv access ##transit list</code></pre>
<p>The list is the same in all IRC channels. You may use private message.</p>
<p>If you deviate from these guidelines, make sure that it is with good reason. Treatment of each case will be handled pragmatically, on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>These are guidelines, and are not set in stone. We, as moderators, may choose to enforce or not enforce these guidelines, in whole or in part, at our own discretion. We are, after all, only human ourselves and we sometimes make mistakes.</p>
