<p>We have chat rooms (IRC based, on the freenode network), which can be used for members of the community to contact each other:</p>
<p>The <em>+s</em> flag is set on all of these channels, so that someone can't know you're in these channels when they run <em>whois</em> on your IRC nick. The only way for someone to know is if they join those channels and see you there.</p>
<p>These are <em>safe spaces</em>. You are free to be yourself here, without judgement.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##Libretransit">##Libretransit</a> This is a support channel, for people who need support. It is not a social channel. For general socializing/discussions (even about things that are off-topic in a trans support group), go to the ##Libretransit-social channel (see below):</li>
<li><a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##Libretransit-social">##Libretransit-social</a> (general lobby or meeting place for the community, for people of all gender identities whether female, male, non-binary, etc. Anyone is welcome. Intersex people and eunuchs are also welcome. This is for socializing. Support goes in the main channel!)</li>
<li><a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=##Libretransit-nsfw">##Libretransit-nsfw</a> - sensitive topics go here.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above links are for <em>web based</em> chat, but you can also use other IRC clients on GNU+Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows, Android, Replicant, iOS etc (GNU+Linux, BSD or Replicant highly recommended, for your <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">freedom from tyranny as a computer user</a>.</p>
<p>Information for connecting to IRC is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Server: chat.freenode.net</li>
<li>Port: 6697</li>
<li>TLS/SSL encryption is <strong>required</strong> on this port. You must enable encryption</li>
<li>Channels are ##Libretransit, ##Libretransit-nsfw and ##Libretransit-meta (make sure to use <em>two</em> hashes instead of one).</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you use the web chat, or a non-web based IRC client, it is highly recommended that you register your nick. Type this into IRC for information about how to register your IRC nickname:</p>
<pre><code>/msg nickserv help register</code></pre>
