<p>Many trans people suffer low self-esteem, especially in the early days of their transition, or pre-transition, and especially if they have more severe body dysphoria. They can feel like they hate themselves, that they are worthless, that they can’t make decisions, guilty for taking good care of themselves, etc and would generally have low confidence.</p>
<p>The UK mental health charity called <em>Mind</em> has a guide on their website: <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/self-esteem/#.WCrjkrN9Knw">how to increase your self-esteem</a></p>
