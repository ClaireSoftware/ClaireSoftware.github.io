<p>You should basically eat calories that are nutritiously dense, and get plenty of exercise. Exercise just means that you are physically active, so for instance walking around a lot or riding a bicycle to work/school can be exercise. Try to eat a balanced diet of vegetables, meats (unless you’re vegetarian or vegan), carbs (potatoes, rice, bread, etc), with plenty of protein (meat, lentils, nuts, broccoli, eggs, etc). Don’t bother with <em>diets</em>, they don’t really work and they’re never long-term even if they do.</p>
<p>For people who are morbidly obese, liposuction is a legitimate way to deal with weight loss.</p>
