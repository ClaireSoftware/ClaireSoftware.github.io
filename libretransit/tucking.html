<p>This is called <em>tucking</em>. You can construct or purchase a <em>gaff</em> or use <em>tape</em>.</p>
<p>If you’re using tape, then put your testicles into your body (push them into it, into your inguinal canals) and hold your penis down and through your legs, so that it points away from you to your rear. Then tape it down. <em>You should cleanly shave your entire genital area before using tape.</em> <strong>TODO: find a good brand/make/type of tape.</strong></p>
<p>For comfort (and safety, and convenience) we recommend using a gaff.</p>
<p>There are plenty of guides out there on the internet for tucking. Use Google and/or YouTube (or maybe other sites) to find what sort of technique you want to use.</p>
<p>You can also use 2 or 3 pairs of tight knickers/panties.</p>
<p>To remove your penis, see <a href="surgery.html">read this page</a>.</p>
