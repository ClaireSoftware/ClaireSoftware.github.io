<p>In addition to this page, there is another site (not run by Transit) that has plenty of info for trans women: <a href="http://www.tsroadmap.com/index.html" class="uri">http://www.tsroadmap.com/index.html</a> - NOTE: it may be a bit outdated, and uses outdated terms like transsexual, etc. TODO: integrate info from there that is missing on Transit, and then remove this link.<br />
The info on tsroadmap may prove useful to trans women living in USA.</p>
<p>Our own info on Transit is incomplete. <strong>TODO: integrate useful information from TA and TSroadmap, onto the transit site</strong>. We are not responsible for information on external websites.</p>
<div class="h"><h2 id="hrt">Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)</h2><a aria-hidden="true" href="#hrt">[link]</a></div>
<p>As a trans woman, typically you would (if you were going to transition) take what is called <em>HRT</em> or <em>hormone replacement therapy</em>. This will give you the same estrogen/testosterone balance as a typical cis woman.</p>
<p>With HRT, several things will happen to you (this list is not exhaustive):</p>
<ul>
<li>You will probably develop breasts (to the size of a typical cis women) over the course of a few years</li>
<li>Your hips will probably widen (over the course of years)</li>
<li>Body hair growth (but not facial hair growth) will be reduced (within 6 months usually). The body hair that does grow will be thinner and less visible. You will stop needing to shave your body as much.</li>
<li>body fat will redistribute to be more female generally (e.g. more fat in your thighs)</li>
<li>Body odour will feminize (You’ll smell female, not male)</li>
<li>The size of your testicles will decrease</li>
<li>Your libido (desire for sex) will seriously decrease</li>
<li>Emotional changes: your emotions will feel more intense (you’re not going to go mad, you’ll still be in control and you’ll normalise after a while to be more stable). They will change the way that you think, basically.</li>
<li>Your skin (whole body) will soften, your veins will become less visible</li>
<li>Decreased muscle mass and strength. E.g. the muscles around your shoulders and upper body will go down</li>
<li>Decreased acne, skin will become less oily</li>
<li>You might lose the ability to ejaculate</li>
<li>You will become infertile</li>
</ul>
<p>More information is on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone_replacement_therapy_%28male-to-female%29">this Wikipedia article</a>.</p>
<p><em>Your mileage may vary! Some people don’t get changes, while others might only see some of these changes, or they will see them in varying degrees. E.g. some trans women will develop large breasts, some will develop small - or no - breasts. It all depends on your body (and what type of hormones you take, at what dosages, etc). All of this depends on age, genetics, etc. There’s no telling what will happen to the individual trans person, you just have to see what happens basically.</em></p>
